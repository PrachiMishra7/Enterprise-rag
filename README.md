# 🤖 EnterpriseRAG — Hallucination-Aware Multi-Agent Enterprise RAG Assistant

> **B.Tech Project | Christ University | AI & Data Analytics**

A production-ready Enterprise AI Assistant with **RAG**, **Multi-Agent Routing**, **Hallucination Detection**, and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User Query
    ↓
Authentication & Role Verification  (JWT + RBAC)
    ↓
Intent Classification / Agent Routing  (Keyword + NLP)
    ↓
Hybrid Document Retrieval  (BM25 + TF-IDF Cosine)
    ↓
Context Re-ranking  (Score fusion)
    ↓
Response Generation  (LLM or extractive — pluggable)
    ↓
Hallucination Detection  (Overlap + Claim Verification + Coverage)
    ↓
Response + Citations + Confidence Score
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enterprise-rag.git
cd enterprise-rag
docker-compose up --build
```

- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API:** http://localhost:8000
- **API Docs:** http://localhost:8000/docs

### Option 2: Run Both Locally (Windows)

Simply run the batch script provided:
```bash
.\start_all.bat
```
This will start both the backend API and the frontend server in separate command prompt windows.

## 🧪 Hallucination Detection

Three-signal scoring:

1. **Word Overlap (40%)** — How much response vocabulary is grounded in retrieved context
2. **Specific Claim Verification (35%)** — Whether figures, numbers, named claims appear in source chunks  
3. **Coverage Score (25%)** — N-gram overlap between response and retrieved context

Responses with **confidence < 45%** are flagged with a warning banner.

## 🔌 API Endpoints

```
POST   /auth/login          Login, get JWT token
POST   /auth/register       Register new user
POST   /documents/upload    Upload + index document (admin roles only)
GET    /documents/list      List role-accessible documents
POST   /query               RAG query with agent routing
GET    /health              Health check
GET    /docs                Swagger UI
```

## 📦 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Python 3.11, FastAPI |
| Authentication | JWT (PyJWT), bcrypt |
| Retrieval | BM25 (custom), TF-IDF Cosine |
| Agent Routing | Keyword intent classification |
| Hallucination | Custom overlap + claim scoring |
| Frontend | Vanilla JS, HTML5, CSS3 |
| Deployment | Docker, Docker Compose |

### Upgrade Path (Production)
- **LLM:** Replace `generate_response()` in `agents/router.py` with OpenAI / Llama / Mistral API call
- **Vector DB:** Replace in-memory storage with FAISS / ChromaDB / Pinecone
- **Embeddings:** Add `sentence-transformers` for real dense embeddings
- **Database:** Replace `USERS_DB` / `CHUNKS_DB` dicts with PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy
